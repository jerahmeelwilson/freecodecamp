            <h2>Here's a time line of Steve Jobs Life</h2>
            <ul id="timeline">
                <li><span>1955</span> - Steven Paul Jobs is born in San Francisco to Joanne Carole Schieble and
                    Abdulfattah Jandali. The then-unmarried couple give up their son to adoption. Paul and Clara Jobs
                    become Jobs' non-biological parents.</li>
                <li><span>1961</span> - The Jobs family moves to Mountain View, Calif., part of what would later become
                    known as Silicon Valley.</li>

                    looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter. Hewlett gives Jobs the parts, as well as an
                    internship with the company that summer.</li>
                <li><span>1970</span> - Meets future Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak through a friend. In Wozniak's 2006
                    autobiography, "iWoz," he notes that the two "hit it off" immediately, despite their four-year age
